Nothing's like the first time
And when it ends, you try to find it all over again
Like something's missing when you are gone
It's just a feeling I can't overcome

Oh, oh, oh
You will be the end of me
You're the end of me, I know, I know, I know
You treat my heart so recklessly
Yeah, it's hard to let you go, go, go, go

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, nobody's gonna love me like you do
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, nobody's gonna love me like you do

Nobody, no, nobody
Nobody, no, nobody like you do (Okay)
Nobody, no, nobody
Nobody, no, no

You got me haunted
'Causе when I sleep
I hear your voice еchoing through my dreams
You keep me falling, so helplessly
Yeah, you could stop bringing me to my knees

Oh, oh, oh
You will be the end of me
You're the end of me, I know, I know, I know
You treat my heart so recklessly
Yeah, it's hard to let you go, go, go, go

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, nobody's gonna love me like you do
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, nobody's gonna love me like you do

Nobody, no, nobody
Nobody, no, nobody like you do (Okay)
Nobody, no, nobody
Nobody, nobody's gonna love me like you do
Nobody, no, nobody
Nobody, no, nobody like you do (Okay)
Nobody, no, nobody
Nobody, nobody's gonna love me like you do
